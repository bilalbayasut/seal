Once you have successfully SSHed into your EC2 instance, install **Docker and Docker Compose**. To do this, you can find all the commands for [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04) and [Docker compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-22-04) .

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: my-rds-instance.c**********.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: bilal
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: Bilal123456
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpressdb
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html

volumes:
  wordpress_data:
```
