# Terraform: HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) Blocks

## Terraform Block Types

As a part of learning HCL we will cover these block types:

1. `terraform` block
2. `provider` block
3. `resource` block
4. `variable` block
5. `locals` block
6. `data` block
7. `module` block
8. `output` block
9. `provisioner` block

We will go over basic structure and purpose of each block. Once we are familiar with these blocks we can start building infrastructure that starts resembling something useful.
